      project: kuhvee.com
      description: >
        Was responsible for team and project management, front-end core and all back-end
        development including email and SMS services. Helped client to fix all logical issues
        which were present in original project, technically analyze tasks and goals, prioritize
        them. As a result project has solid core functionality with few UX design issues, which
        can be fixed rather quickly. All of this didn't prevent client from greatly changing his
        requirements often enough to prolong the development of beta version for almost a
        year.
        Was forced to quit because of contract organizational disputes with client who firstly
        confirmed contract reorganization at certain date, but then started acting like that talk
        never happened. Did my best to resolve the dispute, but client for some unknown
        reason didn't want to switch contract to another with the same hourly rate, but with
        cleaner description. Whole team quit after me, because of such client's behavior.
        Project is operational, but seems abandoned due to overdue SSL certificate.

        Fixed completely broken and archaic PHP web app. Hard to express what was achieved
        during this job. In general, prepared project to relatively successful demo and convinced
        client that it needs to be remade.
        Project is down, because of awful code quality and impossibility of further
        improvements.
