    I'm an experienced and responsible software developer with management and leadership skills, fast learner.
    Preferable field of work is servers or databases. The secondary area of expertise is front-end development.
    Prefer challenging tasks over calm routine work.  I spent five years of life learning different aspects of math, programming, logic.
    Started a software developer carrier as a freelancer and was quite successful in it.
    I'm looking for long term jobs opportunities cause it helps to utilize my skills better, but have nothing against 3-6 months projects.

      description: >
        Private order from my friend's boss.
        My first experience with chatbots.
        I was asked to create a lightweight bot which will manage daily team reports aka standup meetings.
        The additional requirement was not to use a remote database to keep things simple,
        which was a limiting factor because SQLite has minimal functionality compared to standard relational databases.
      achievements:
        - Created Flask like Slack RTM wrapper
        - Created a relatively simple database schema which expands usage of the bot beyond simple standup meetings.
        - "Created AWS deployment script which requires nothing more than launched EC2 instance created using project's AMI."
        - Created bot technical concept which can be expanded to become good subscription based Slack bot service.

        Unfortunately, the project didn't succeed businesswise.
        The idea of the project is pretty simple.

        search for volunteers who are the best fit for the job defined in the task description.

        I was responsible for fixing and analyzing of an old and completely broken PHP web app.
        In general, the project consisted of the bugs and simple mistakes like opening new session each time database query performed.
        After I helped to reanimate it to show it on the demo, the project got scrapped due to a very unprofessional database schema design as well as many other significant problems.
        I convinced the client to remake it using modern approaches and therefore got assigned as Lead Developer of the Kuhvee.

        to PDF conversion browsers often ruin good looking HTML/CSS template by breaking page several times.

        React util for generic form creation.
        Its primary purpose is a creation of a unified form data
        structure with an ability to nest forms which in theory simplifies form creation
        because each generic form can be easily split into independent forms and further used in other forms with no problems.
        Additionally, it provides a convenient way to add validation rules and fields focus management based on the form state instead of callbacks.

        As a result, we found that it will be tough and risky to dedicate our lives solely to indie game dev.

        My magnum opus which was not destined to become successful, unfortunately.
        The project is a volunteers management service.
        It's designed around the concept of tasks which automatically search and invite volunteers who fit task actions description.
        Useful but straightforward service. Unfortunately, it didn't succeed businesswise.
        Probably because the client was unable to focus on the main features of the product and was frequently changing his mind about product business logic.
        Eventually, such a style of decision making led to a financial shortage and client's attempts to trick the whole team into waiting an unknown amount of time until he gets new investments.
